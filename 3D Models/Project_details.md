## 3D Model of a Simple Robotic Arm

### Objectives
To apply learned skills about 3D modelling and the design process using CAD software, in order to further develop, and demonstrate, skill and understanding in designing parts and full models for robotics projects.

### Development
In order to fully assemble the arm, it is first necessary to design and model each part of the arm separately. Once all parts were designed and fully modeled, it was then possible to assemble together all the different parts by importing each part file into one assembly file.

### Results
The final product is a model, and a series of sketches for each part of the model. The sketches can be used for manufacture of the parts, while the full assembled model serves as reference for how the parts fit together. Additionally, when adapted to the correct format for a given software, the models of the individual parts can be used for additive and subtractive manufacturing techniques, such as in 3d printing or laser cutting.
