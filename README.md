## About Me
Ever since I was young, as far back as I can remember, I've always loved making things, and wanted to be an inventor. I quickly learned that, in the modern day, we don't have 'inventors' _per se_ anymore. Instead, it is the work of an engineer that best fits the vision of what I always wanted to do. So, since the young age of around 4, or 5, I decided I wanted to become an engineer. And though my goal wasn't nearly anywhere as specific as it is now, I have worked hard since that day to continue on my journey to becoming an engineer. Nearing the end of elementary, I began my journey in learning how to program  with HTML 4 and CSS. As time passed on, and technology began to grow at an increasing rate, I would hear all kinds of stories about robots and new advances in machine learning. My love of sc-fi, like the works of Isaac Asimov or Frank Herbert, had me really excited for the newest developments that I would hear about on occasion. I still remember being so excited for the future of machine learning when I heard that goolge had finally succeeded in developing AlphaGo to a stage where it could beat humans at the ancient game of Go. I was really impressed because I knew that the computers that played chess had been able to play so well because the could always calculate the most optimal move for any given board state, something I remember being emphasised was impossible for Go, being that the board states were beyond what a computer could manage to calculate. I began to imagine about computers with imagination, and what it eould be like if we could one day create Artificial Intellegences (AI) so advanced that they would be indistinguishable from humans.

Since then, I've aimed my sights on robotics and AI. Having studied highschool in Canada, I was able to cater my education towards the robotics and the programming that I so loved. I even designed for my course selection to match up to the pre-requisites for the Universsity of Toronto from the very first year. During my time in highschool, I learned how to program Java, Javasscript and other derivative languages, as well as a small amount of arduino.

<!---
I am studying Computational Robotics Engineering at the Universidad Politécnica de Yucatán (UPY). Though I have some projects and programs that I have developed before my time at the UPY, most of these programs are ones that were made with the sole intention of learning to program. I began my programming career some, roughly, 7 years ago. I began by learning HTML and CSS, though these are technically markdown languages, It helped to learn the basics of syntax and the general sturcture of code. From then, I also learned Java as my first programming language. But, during my time studying robotics, I have become intamately familliar with programming in Python. Though relatively simple, Python has proven to be a very versatile tool that I have found applies to most any field involved in robotics. 

I hope in the future to continue my academic journey, by making my forray into research, and I hope to study a doctorate degree. Currently, I am considering studying in the USA, because many of the universties there allow one to apply directly for the Ph.D. degree.
At the moment, I am working towards a research assistant position with Dr. Didier Samayoa Ochoa.
