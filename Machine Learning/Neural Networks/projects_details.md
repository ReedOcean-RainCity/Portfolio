## Project 1: Testing NN
### Objectives
To test how various parameters affect the efficiency and perfomance of the network, this is achieved by testing, graphing, and comparing the perfomance of the network as the parameters change. This project has aided in my learning and understanding of the theory behind and the application skills of programming NNs.
